Simon Game

Overview

Simon Game is a simple memory-based game where players replicate an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling.

How to Play

Press the 'A' key to start the game.

Observe the highlighted button (with sound) that represents the first step of the pattern.

Click the buttons in the same order as the pattern presented.

With each level, a new step is added to the pattern.

Repeat the sequence accurately to advance to the next level.

If you make a mistake, the game ends, and you can restart by pressing the 'A' key.

Features

Interactive Gameplay: Buttons light up and play unique sounds.

Dynamic Difficulty: The sequence grows longer with each level.

Game Over State: Visual and textual feedback when the player makes an error.

Reset Option: Restart the game after a mistake.

Technologies Used
